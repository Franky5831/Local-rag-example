The Amazon discharges more water than the next several largest rivers combined, creating a low‑salinity plume that can stretch hundreds of kilometers into the Atlantic.
The Nile flows north because the Mediterranean is at a lower elevation than its sources in East Africa; flow direction follows gradient, not compass.
Many big rivers meander. As bends tighten, rivers can cut new channels, leaving oxbow lakes. Engineers model this with sine‑generated curves and bank erosion rates.
The Danube crosses or borders ten countries, the most of any river in Europe, making it a core transport and ecology corridor.
The Mississippi watershed drains about 41% of the contiguous United States. Nutrients from farm runoff contribute to a seasonal hypoxic “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Yangtze hosts the world’s largest hydropower station, Three Gorges Dam. Large dams shift sediment budgets and can starve deltas downstream.
River colors hint at suspended load. Glacial flour turns water turquoise. Tannin‑rich wetlands make streams tea‑colored.
Rivers migrate. Old channels are mapped as paleochannels on floodplains. City planning near them must price flood risk and subsidence.
