Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (robusta) dominate global trade. Arabica offers nuanced acidity. Robusta adds body and crema and has more caffeine.
Green coffee is mostly cellulose, water, sugars, and chlorogenic acids. Roasting triggers Maillard reactions and caramelization, building flavor precursors.
Roast level shifts solubility. Lighter roasts often show higher origin character and require finer grinds to extract evenly.
Espresso is a method, not a bean. It uses ~9 bars of pressure, fine grind, and short contact time. Dial‑in balances dose, yield, and time.
Water chemistry matters. Magnesium enhances extraction of aromatic compounds. Hardness and alkalinity affect perceived acidity and bitterness.
Crema is mostly CO₂ and emulsified oils. It signals freshness but is not a quality guarantee by itself.
Decaffeination commonly uses supercritical CO₂ or ethyl acetate. Flavor loss depends on process and bean quality.
Spent grounds can de‑odorize refrigerators or enrich compost. Oils in grounds can clog pipes, so disposal needs care.
