Voyagers carry golden records with sounds and images from Earth. Both spacecraft have left the heliosphere and still send limited data.
New Horizons revealed Pluto’s heart‑shaped Tombaugh Regio and nitrogen glaciers with convection cells. Its trajectory now targets distant Kuiper Belt objects.
Rosetta orbited comet 67P and deployed Philae, the first soft landing on a comet nucleus. Low gravity and shadowed terrain complicated anchoring.
Juno uses a highly elliptical polar orbit to dodge Jupiter’s radiation belts while measuring gravity, magnetism, and deep atmospheric flows.
Solar‑sailing concepts like JAXA’s IKAROS test thin reflective films to gain momentum from photons, lowering propellant needs.
Mars landers rely on aeroshells, parachutes, and retrothrust. The “seven minutes of terror” combine autonomous entry, descent, and landing.
Deep‑space antennas in the Deep Space Network coordinate across continents to maintain links as Earth rotates.
Power budgets drive design. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators keep instruments alive far from the Sun where solar panels are inefficient.
