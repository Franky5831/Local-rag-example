Modern rules stabilized in the 19th century, but castling and the two‑square pawn move appeared in Europe centuries earlier.
En passant captures a pawn that advances two squares as if it moved one. The right exists only on the move immediately after the advance.
A “smothered mate” uses a knight to checkmate a king boxed in by its own pieces, often after a sacrifice on f7 or f2.
FIDE titles include CM, FM, IM, and GM. Titles are lifetime once earned, unlike ratings which fluctuate with performance.
Tablebases solve endgames with perfect play. With seven pieces or fewer, they tell whether a position is won, drawn, or lost and the exact distance to mate.
Time controls shape style. Bullet rewards pattern retrieval. Classical allows deep calculation and endgame precision.
The 50‑move rule declares a draw if no capture or pawn move occurs for 50 moves, unless specific exceptions apply in some events.
Chess engines evaluate with centipawns. A +100 score equals one pawn. Strong engines mix search depth, heuristics, and neural nets.
