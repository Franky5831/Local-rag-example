The refrigerator is a freestanding unit, 180 cm in height, 60 cm in width, with a total capacity of 340 L (250 L refrigerator, 90 L freezer). The exterior casing is powder-coated steel, matte white finish. The door handle is brushed stainless steel, integrated with a magnetic seal rated for −25 °C tolerance.

The cooling system operates on an inverter compressor using R600a refrigerant. Average power draw is 42 W, yielding an estimated daily consumption of 1.0 kWh. The system maintains internal compartments at 4 °C (refrigerator) and −18 °C (freezer) under ambient conditions up to 32 °C. Temperature regulation is managed by a digital PID controller with ±0.5 °C variance.

Interior layout:
- Top shelf: 12-unit egg tray, HDPE plastic.
- Middle shelf: 1 L glass milk bottle, 3 tomatoes (approx. 150 g each) stored in an open polypropylene container to avoid condensation buildup.
- Crisper drawer: humidity-controlled chamber, currently empty.
- Freezer compartment: single evaporator coil, manual defrost mode, no frost accumulation observed.

Noise emission is measured at 36 dB(A). Annual energy use is approximately 365 kWh, rated A++ efficiency under EU standards.
