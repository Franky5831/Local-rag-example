The Shrek movie is adapted from William Steig’s 1990 picture book. Early production used Chris Farley as Shrek before Mike Myers took over the role.
Myers recorded the dialogue twice, then chose a Scottish accent. Re‑recording reportedly added millions to the budget but sharpened character identity.
“Shrek” premiered in 2001 and competed at the Cannes Film Festival. It won the inaugural Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2002.
The movie’s fairy‑tale send‑ups target classic tropes: a dragon guarding a tower, a transformation twist, and a quest that subverts chivalry.
Duloc’s tidy theme‑park vibe and the short, ruler‑obsessed villain read as satire of studio rival culture and sanitized fantasy.
The soundtrack leans on pop placement rather than original songs, helping scenes carry modern pacing and tone.
Advances in hair, mud, and subsurface scattering improved the look of ogre skin and swamp water for its time.
The franchise expanded into sequels, shorts, and games; the first film remains the most referenced in internet culture.
