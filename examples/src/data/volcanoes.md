Volcanoes form at subduction zones, rifts, and hotspots. Magma chemistry steers eruption style: basalt flows easily, rhyolite traps gas.
The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) ranks events on a logarithmic scale. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was VEI 5; Tambora in 1815 was VEI 7 and drove a “year without a summer.”
Ash is fragmented glass. It abrades jet engines and collapses roofs when wet. Fine ash can travel thousands of kilometers and alter sunsets.
Lava is not always red. Pāhoehoe forms smooth ropes; ‘a‘ā is blocky. Underwater eruptions build pillow lavas as skins quench instantly.
Monitoring blends seismology, gas ratios, ground deformation, and satellite thermal data. A sudden uptick across signals can precede eruption.
Some lakes sit atop carbonated magma systems. At Cameroon’s Lake Nyos in 1986, a limnic eruption released CO₂, suffocating nearby villages.
Volcanic soils are fertile. Populations cluster on flanks despite risk, trading safety for agriculture and water.
Shield volcanoes like Mauna Loa are broad and low. Stratovolcanoes like Fuji are steep and layered by alternating ash and lava.
